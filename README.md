# 📊 Data Jam: Visualize with #TidyTuesday

Welcome to the **Data Jam** session! In this hands-on workshop, we’ll explore, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets from the [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this session is to:
- Practice data wrangling and visualization using tools like R and the tidyverse.
- Gain experience working with real, messy, and interesting datasets.
- Share your visual storytelling and learn from others.

Whether you're a beginner or experienced data enthusiast, you're welcome here!

## 🗓️ What is #TidyTuesday?

**#TidyTuesday** is a weekly data project by the R4DS Online Learning Community that encourages data exploration and visualization using open datasets. Each week, a new dataset is shared with the public.
